# News Chat

Turn today's news into a conversation you actually want to read.

News Chat fetches live current news across your chosen topics and delivers it as a natural conversation between two characters — not a boring feed of headlines.

## How It Works

1. **Pick your topics** — AI & Tech, Fitness, Sports, Politics, Finance, and more (10 categories)
2. **AI searches the web** — Uses Claude API with web search to find today's real news
3. **Generates a conversation** — Two characters discuss the news naturally, connecting stories across topics
4. **Caches for instant replay** — Briefings are saved to persistent storage so you can resume instantly
